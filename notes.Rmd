### 1. Intro class 

- More intuition, less coding
- Many models 
- Papers after each part 
- 

#### K-means and PAM

- k-means - abstract point
- PAM - concrete point form dataset

PAM:
1. Find set of points to be medoids
2. assign every point to the closest medoid 
3. 


#### Distances

Euclidean: Sum of squares of distances
Mannhatan: Sum of absolutes of distances
Minkovski: Generalised version

- Minkovski - when everything's not working, gives "round" results


#### Silhouette 

Is number of clusters right? 

For each observation check if the assgned cluster is the closest one. Silhouette for one observation is difference between my cluster to next-closest cluster. Silhouette for all is the mean. 

Higher the better. Really bad when negative


### Class 2
Kmeans goals:

- Run classification
- Test measures
- Predictions
